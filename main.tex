% Document Content  %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This is a modular document.
% The 'subfiles' package allows you to typeset the included
% documents separately from the main document, so that you
% can view only pieces of the thesis at a time.
% See https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Modular_Documents
%
% Subfiles that contain references: You can just run
% `biber subfilename` on them when compiling them individually.
% There is no need to make them reference the bibliography database
% 'refs.bib', as they inherit the reference from this file.
