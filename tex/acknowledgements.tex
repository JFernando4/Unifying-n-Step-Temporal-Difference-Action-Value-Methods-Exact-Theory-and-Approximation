\begin{acknowledgements} 

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Richard Sutton for his guidance and advice.
Over the last two years, he has always provided good judgment and advice on research, writing, and life in general.
Second, I would like to thank my co-authors Kris De Asis and Zach G. Holland for helping me get my career as a researcher started.
Kris was responsible for the $19$-state random walk experiment and Zach worked on the stochastic windy gridworld experiment.
However, beyond their collaboration on our paper, they have always provided a good source of support and discussion that have led to many new ideas and projects.
Third, I would like to thank Huizhen Yu for helping me verify my proofs and being such a good source of intuitive understanding of core reinforcement learning ideas.
Finally, I would like to thank the reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence lab for being there to support me and help me at every step of my master's degree.
