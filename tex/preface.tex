Some of the research presented in this thesis was published in 32nd AAAI conference in 2018 on a paper titled "Multi-step reinforcement learning: a unifying algorithm" \parencite{qsigma-paper} and in \citeauthor{sutton2018}'s book draft \parencite{sutton2018}.

Chapter \ref{ch3:qsigma} presents the $n$-step $Q(\sigma)$ algorithm as it was first introduced in \citeauthor{sutton2018} (\citeyear{sutton2018}).
The second convergence proof in chapter \ref{ch4:convergence} was worked out by me and was first presented in the paper by \citeauthor{qsigma-paper} (\citeyear{qsigma-paper}).
The first and second experiments in chapter \ref{ch5:empirical_evaluation} were also present in the paper \citeauthor{qsigma-paper} (\citeyear{qsigma-paper}) and were run by my co-authors Kris De Asis and Zach G. Holland, respectively. 
The third experiment in chapter \ref{ch5:empirical_evaluation} was originally presented in \citeauthor{qsigma-paper} (\citeyear{qsigma-paper}), but in this thesis we present a corrected version of it since there was a bug in the original Mountain Cliff environment.
I was responsible for this last experiment. 
This work and the publication "Multi-step reinforcement learning: a unifying algorithm" was led by professor Richard Sutton at the University of Alberta.
